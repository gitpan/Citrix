=head1 NAME

Citrix::SessOp - Disconnect or Logoff from an existing Citrix Session.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Control Citrix session state by launching associated command line utilities.
The module user should take care of gaining authority to (by host/user,
whatever) execute these commands successfully on Citrix Farm as the
current process running user (It seems Citrix commands / protocol map the user
1-to-1 to the server end). Lacking this permission the commands will fail.

Module aims to provide proper return values and error messages
when things fail, but this is not a substitute for first taking care of
of proper permissions (for lauching Citrix commands) with your local Citrix Admin.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Citrix::SessOp;
  my $fms = Citrix::getfarms('idx' => 1);
  my $farmctx = $fms->{'cairo'};
  my $csop = Citrix::SessOp->new($farmctx);
  
  # Disconnect (leaves session idle, to "returnable" state)
  $err = $csop->disconnect("the-cx-host-12:8879");
  
  # Log Off Completely (Terminating UNIX X-Windows session)
  $err = $csop->logoff("the-cx-host-12:8879");

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package Citrix::SessOp;

our $VERSION = "0.24";

#use strict;
#use warnings;

=head2 my $cop = Citrix::SessOp->new($farmctx);

Create a new Citrix session operation by L<Citrix::Farm> context ($fc).
The ops available later are disconnect() / logoff() (See method docs on each for details).
Return session operation instance.

=cut
sub new {
   my ($class, $fc) = @_;
   #my ($h, $sid) = split(/:/, $hostsess);
   if (!$fc) {return(undef);}
   return(bless({ 'fc' => $fc}, $class)); # 'hs' => $hostsess,
}


=head2 $err = $cop->disconnect("the-cx-host-12:8879");

Disconnect a Citrix session By Host Session ID ($hostsess in format "$hostname:$sessid").
Disconnect persists the session state (leaves applications in the state they were before disconnect).
Return 0 for success, 1 (and up) for errors.

=cut

sub disconnect {
   my ($op, $hostsess) = @_;
   opexec($op, $hostsess, 'ctxdisconnect');
   
}

=head2 $err = $cop->logoff("the-cx-host-12:8879");

Logoff from a Citrix session By Host Session ID ($hostsess in format "$hostname:$sessid").
Logging off completely destroys the session state (closes apps and terminates X-Windows session).
Return 0 for success, 1 (and up) for errors.

=cut
sub logoff {
   my ($op, $hostsess) = @_;
   opexec($op, $hostsess, 'ctxlogoff');
}
